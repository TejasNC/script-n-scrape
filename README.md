## Week 1

As you explore these resources, remember that each step is building the foundation of your data science and programming journey. Learning Python and its libraries will open doors to analyzing data, automating tasks, and solving real-world problems. With patience and practice, you'll develop skills that highly adaptable to countless fields.

Embrace the learning processâ€”ask questions, experiment, and explore! Every new concept mastered is a step closer to becoming confident with data and building tools that create impact.

Alright, enough of unasked motivation; lets go to the good stuff.  Extensive library support is one of the primary reasons Python is considered a "god" language for many modern applications (okay, maybe a bit of an exaggeration here ðŸ˜‰). In this week, we will also explore some of the  fundamental Python libaries that have universal applications. 

- Install and setup [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html), [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/1.26/user/absolute_beginners.html), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/index.html#getting-started), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html) and save their documentation for reference.

> [!NOTE] 
> You should get comfortable with reading documentation. Having the ability to navigate through formal documentation is must for a programmer.

> [!TIP]
> You are advised to go through the Python Basics part rigourously. For the Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib, doing a quick rundown shall suffice.

- ### Resources

    - Python - https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp : For starters you can read till Python File Handling
    - Numpy -https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy/default.asp : For starters you can read till NumPy Array Filtering
    - Pandas - https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/default.asp : It is a short module, having one read will be okay
    - Matplotlib - https://www.w3schools.com/python/matplotlib_intro.asp : Just go over it, you are not expected to remember anything. 

>[!NOTE] 
> In case anyone does not like w3schools ke resources, you can contact Avinash. You will be given other simpler resources.
