Python is a language in which you can do anything and everything. You just have to <b>FIND</b> the right function (for most of the basic parts). So if you are struggling on how to do something, here are the steps you need to follow:
  <ol>
    <li>Try to remember</li>
    <li>Google search and look into the documentation</li>
    <li>Google search and you will most probably find some stack overflow post</li>
    <li>Contact us</li>
  </ol>
  Also, as you can see, no GPT has been mentioned anywhere. So please try and avoid it as much as possible :)

Also, if you are still hungry for questions/want to learn more, you can freely contact any of us.
