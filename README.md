## Week 1

As you explore these resources, remember that each step is building the foundation of your data science and programming journey. Learning Python and its libraries will open doors to analyzing data, automating tasks, and solving real-world problems. With patience and practice, you'll develop skills that highly adaptable to a variety of fields.

Enjoy the learning processâ€”ask questions, experiment, and explore!

Alright, enough of unasked motivation; lets go to the good stuff. Python's extensive library support is one of the primary reasons it is considered a "god" language for many modern applications (okay, maybe a bit of an exaggeration here ðŸ˜‰). In this week, we will also explore some of the  fundamental Python libaries that have universal applications.

### Setting Up The Environment

- Install and setup [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html), [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/1.26/user/absolute_beginners.html), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/index.html#getting-started), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html) and save their documentation for reference.
  
> [!NOTE] 
> You should get comfortable with reading documentation. Having the ability to navigate through formal documentation is must for a programmer.

- Understanding [Python Virtual Environment](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-virtual-environment/) (Can be skipped)

- Setting up Jupyter: Jupyter is a platform which lets you write and run code and visualize data in one place. You can skip this if you want but eventually at some point in your life, you will have to work on Jupyter.
  - For Windows Users: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/install-jupyter-notebook-in-windows/
  - For Mac Users: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-jupyter-notebook-on-macos/ 
  - For Linux Users: you are smart enough to figure it out yourselves 

  Using VS Code is highly recommended. The instructions for setting up Jupyter can be found [here](https://medium.com/@claudia.nikel/how-to-setup-a-jupyter-notebook-in-vs-code-w-virtual-env-kernels-install-packages-884cf643375e)

- Understanding GitHub: go through [this](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/github-and-git-tutorial-for-beginners) for a basic exposure with specific focus on how to stage and commit changes, pushing changes to origin and forking a GitHub repo.<br>
Git can sometimes be confusing. If you have any problem while working with git/GitHub, please contact any of us.

### Resources

> [!TIP]
> You are advised to go through the Python Basics part rigourously. For the Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib, doing a quick rundown shall suffice.
  
  - Python - https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp : For starters you can read till Python File Handling
  - Numpy -https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy/default.asp : For starters you can read till NumPy Array Filtering
  - Pandas - https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/default.asp : It is a short module, having one read will be okay
  - Matplotlib - https://www.w3schools.com/python/matplotlib_intro.asp : Just go over it, you are not expected to remember anything. 

- ### Video Tutorials For Lazy People:

    You are free to follow the educator you like. 

    - Numpy - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUT1VHiLmmI
    - Pandas - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uvysYbKdjM 
    - Matplotlib - w3 padh le 

- I have uploaded 6 Tutorials, which you can go through for a quick refresher.

- Just save these 2 links for some good NumPy and Pandas Practice problems (to be done later on when you become pro, you are definitely not required to solve them now):
  - [Numpy 100 puzzles](https://github.com/rougier/numpy-100)
  - [Pandas 100 puzzles](https://github.com/ajcr/100-pandas-puzzles)


- Lastly, Python is a language in which you can do anything and everything. You just have to <b>FIND</b> the right function (for most of the basic parts). So if you are struggling on how to do something, here are the steps you need to follow:
  <ol>
  <li>Try to remember</li>
  <li>Google search and look into the documentation</li>
  <li>Google search and you will most probably find some stack overflow post</li>
  <li>Contact us</li>
  </ol>
  Also, as you can see, no GPT has been mentioned anywhere. So please try and avoid it as much as possible :)

- Also, if you are still hungry for questions/want to learn more, you can freely contact any of us.

## Week 2

This week we will learn HTML, CSS and Javascript.
