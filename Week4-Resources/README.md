# Week 4

This week, we be looking at how to scrape Dynamically Rendered Web-Pages (hope you already know what this means by now). 

Python library [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/) allows us to do that.

So that will be our task for this week. Have a look at this:

After going through this, you should directly start working on the final project.
