    "This problem gives you an intro to doing Data Analysis with Pandas. The question is kept sligtly open ended on in the sense that we have not provided the exact steps you should take to arrive at the answers on purpose. You can refer to the tutorial provided to you earlier for inspiration. You should arrive at all the answers by writing appropriate code, eye-balling the data and reporting answers is not allowed. \n",
