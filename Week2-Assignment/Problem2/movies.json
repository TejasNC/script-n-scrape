        "Part Two is an inarguable marvel technically, almost leaving its Oscar-grade predecessor for dust.",
        "Part Two is as grand as it is intimate, and while Hans Zimmer\u2019s score once again blasts your eardrums into submission, and the theatre seats rumble with every cresting sand worm, it\u2019s the choice moments of silence that really leave their mark.",

        "The art of cinematic spectacle is alive and rocking in Dune: Part Two, and it\u2019s a blast.",
        "Dune: Part Two is certainly up there with some of the best science fiction movies I\u2019ve ever seen.",
        "Villeneuve\u2019s film is a grand success, working on an even broader canvas than the first Dune\u2014but it\u2019s tinged with deep mournfulness, a quality that sets it apart from its blockbuster contemporaries."

        "The cumulative effect is so stunning and antithetical to anything Hollywood is doing at the moment \u2013 the equally audacious Barbie aside \u2013 that it feels like a completely different art form. And, frankly, hallelujah for that.",
        "Oppenheimer is one of those shoot-for-the-moon projects that feels thrilling and wonky, brilliant and overstuffed, too much and yet not enough. It\u2019s also a movie that brings to mind the difficult era-spanning epics of yesteryear, from Reds to The Right Stuff, and is a movie made by adults for adults yet done with the sweep and majesty we now associate with movies made for kids and teens.",
        "Taut and sprawling, riveting and haunting: firing on all cylinders, Nolan tackles world-changing history with fearsome force and focus.",
        "Oppenheimer is a towering achievement not just for Nolan, but for everyone involved. It is the kind of film that makes you appreciative of every aspect of filmmaking, blowing you away with how it all comes together in such a fitting fashion.",
        "A masterfully constructed character study from a great director operating on a whole new level. A film that you don\u2019t merely watch, but must reckon with."

You will likely leave Joker feeling like I did: unsettled and ready to debate the film for years to come.",

        "Bold, devastating and utterly beautiful, Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix have not just reimagined one of the most iconic villains in cinema history, but reimagined the comic book movie itself.",
        "Phoenix has created a masterful performance for a film which itself feels like a masterpiece: a cracked masterpiece.",
        "What a gloriously daring and explosive film Joker is. It\u2019s a tale that\u2019s almost as twisted as the man at its centre, bulging with ideas and pitching towards anarchy."
