    "# Making a Feedforward Neural Network from scratch (Optional)\n",
    "We will try to make a feedforward neural network from scratch. This is an optional assignment. If you are even a little bit familiar with neural networks, know what neurons, weights, biases, feed-forward network, back propagration, gradient descent, activation functions are, then you can start right away. If not, don't worry. You can take a look at this medium article: https://medium.com/@waadlingaadil/learn-to-build-a-neural-network-from-scratch-yes-really-cac4ca457efc and try to learn what all these terms/topics are. Just knowing what they are won't help. I would recommend you to do the math along with the reading (because math is awesome!). Also avoid using for loops in this whole assignment. Now let's start!!"
